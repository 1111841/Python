Python if statement:
The if statement is used to test a particular condition and if the condition is true, it executes a block of code known as if-block. The condition of if statement can be any valid logical expression which can be either evaluated to true or false.

syntax:

if expression:
    statemtnt

Example:
num = int(input("enter the number?"))
if num%2==0:
  print(" Number is even ")
Output:
enter the number:10
Number is even 
> 

Print largest three numbers:
a = int(input("Enter a? "));  
b = int(input("Enter b? "));  
c = int(input("Enter c? "));  
if a>b and a>c:  
    print("a is largest");  
if b>a and b>c:  
    print("b is largest");  
if c>a and c>b:  
    print("c is largest");  
	
output:
Enter a? 100
Enter b? 120
Enter c? 130
c is largest


Python if else statement:

syntax:
if condition:
   # block of statements
else:
   # another block of statements
   
   
example:
age= int(input("enter your age?"))
if age>=18:
   print(" you are eligible for marriage" );
else:
   print(" Sorry! you have to wait it");
   
   
Python elif statement:

syntax:
if expression1:
    # block of statements
elif expression2:
    # block of statements
else:
    # block of statements
	
example:
a= int(input(" enter value of a:"))
b= int(input(" enter value of b"))
c= int(input(" enter the value of c"))
if a>b and a>c:
    print(a)
elif b>a and b>c:
    print(b)
else:
    print(c)
output:

enter value of a:10
enter value of b20
enter the value of c30
30


Python Loops:

When we need to run a single statement or set of statement, loop concept come in mind.

Types of loops:
While loop
For loop
Nested loop

While loop: Repeat a statements or group of statements whilea given condition is True. It test the condition before executing the loop body.
Syntax:
while <condition>:
  {code block}
Example:
counter=0
while counter<10:
   counter = counter+3
   print("Python Loops")
 
for loop: It is designed to repeatedly execute a code block while iterating through a list, tuple, dictionary or other iterables objects of python. The process of traversing a sequence is known as iteration.

syntax:
for i in list:
  statements
  
  
example:
numbers=[4,2,6,7,3,4]
square=0
output=[]
for i in numbers:
   square = value ** 2
   output.append(square)
print("The list of output is", output)

Using else statement with for loop:

string= "Python Loop"
for s in string:
  if s == "o":
     print("IF Block")
else:
   print(s)
   
Range() function in Python:
with the help of the range() function, we may produce a series of numbers. 

example :- range(10) gives value from 0 to 9.
